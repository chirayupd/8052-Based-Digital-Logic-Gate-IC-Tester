# 8052-Based-Digital-Logic-Gate-IC-Tester

In electronics, testing tool is a major part when it comes to laboratory work. Itâ€™s a part of everyday activity to use one or several ICs while working on electronics systems. Digital IC tester is a microcontroller-based circuitry that tests whether the IC is in good working condition or bad condition. In industries, testing of the product is an expensive and time-consuming process. Before making the whole system work, testing is mandatorily performed to avoid errors and undesired results. Similarly, in educational institutions, while performing practical it is necessary to check the IC whether it is good or bad before performing experiments. Many small faults at IC level makes system perform inaccurately and produce wrong outputs. Thus, the aim of this research is to build a Logic tester capable of testing most 74xx series logic gates integrated circuits using a Microcontroller (AT89S52). This project is basically designed to test the condition of the gates in a logic gate IC by simulating its characteristics using the truth table of the particular IC. Different design approaches were compared and finally one approach was implemented. Each individual module was designed separately. After successful simulation and testing, they were put together to create the finalized version.
